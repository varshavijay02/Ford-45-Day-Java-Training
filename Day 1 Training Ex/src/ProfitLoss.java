//Sam purchased x dozens of toys at the rate of Rs. y per dozen. He sold each one of them at the rate of Rs. z. Can you please help him out percentage of profit?
//Given the values of x, y and z, write a program to compute Sam's profit percentage.
//Example:
//Dozens of toys purchased (x) = 20
//Rate per dozen (y) = Rs. 375
//Selling price per toy (z) = Rs. 33
//Cost Price of 1 toy = 375/12 = Rs. 31.25
//Selling Price of 1 toy = Rs.33
//Profit = 33 - 31.25 = Rs. 1.75
//Profit % = 1.75 / 31.25 * 100 = 5.6%
//
//Input Format:
//Input consists of 3 integers â€“ x, y and z.
//        x - Number of dozens purchased.
//        y - Cost per dozen.
//        z - Selling price per item.
//
//
//
//Output Format:
//Refer Sample Input and Output for formatting details. The profit percentage needs to be printed correct to 2 decimal places.
//Sample Input and Output:
//        [All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]
//Enter the number of dozens of toys purchased
//20
//Enter the price per dozen
//375
//Enter the selling price of 1 toy
//33
//Sam's profit percentage is 5.60 percent
